<h1 class="center">Time and Distance</h1>

<h2>Concept Overview:</h2>
<p>
    Time and Distance problems involve calculating the time taken, distance covered, or speed based on the given
    information. These concepts are essential in real-life scenarios, such as determining travel times, vehicle speeds,
    or planning journeys. The fundamental formula to remember is:
</p>
<p><strong>Speed (S) = Distance (D) / Time (T)</strong></p>
<p>
    Key points to remember:
<ul>
    <li>If speed is given in km/h, time should be in hours, and distance in kilometers.</li>
    <li>If speed is given in m/s, time should be in seconds, and distance in meters.</li>
    <li>To convert km/h to m/s, multiply by (5/18), and to convert m/s to km/h, multiply by (18/5).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Types of Problems</h2>
<p>Some typical types of problems include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Calculating distance, given speed and time.</li>
    <li>Finding time taken, given speed and distance.</li>
    <li>Determining speed, given time and distance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Example</h2>
<div class="example">
    <h3>Example Scenario:</h3>
    <p>
        Imagine you are planning a road trip. You know that the distance from your city to the destination is 300 km,
        and you plan to drive at an average speed of 60 km/h. You want to calculate how long the trip will take.
    </p>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <p>
        - We need to find the time taken for the journey.<br>
        - The distance (D) = 300 km, and the speed (S) = 60 km/h.
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution Steps:</h3>
        <p>
            Time = Distance / Speed<br>
            Time = 300 km / 60 km/h = 5 hours<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The journey will take <b>5 hours</b>.
        </p>

<h2>Practice Problems</h2>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Problem 1:</h3>
    <p>
        A cyclist travels at a speed of 15 km/h. How long will it take him to cover a distance of 45 km?
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            Speed = 15 km/h, Distance = 45 km.<br>
            Time = Distance / Speed = 45 / 15 = 3 hours.<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> It will take <b>3 hours</b> to cover 45 km.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Problem 2:</h3>
    <p>
        A car covers a distance of 120 kilometers in 2 hours. What is its speed in km/h?
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            Distance = 120 km, Time = 2 hours.<br>
            Speed = Distance / Time = 120 / 2 = 60 km/h.<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The car's speed is <b>60 km/h</b>.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Problem 3:</h3>
    <p>
        John walks at a speed of 4 km/h. How much distance will he cover in 1.5 hours?
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            Speed = 4 km/h, Time = 1.5 hours.<br>
            Distance = Speed * Time = 4 * 1.5 = 6 km.<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> John will cover <b>6 km</b>.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Problem 4:</h3>
    <p>
        A train travels at 90 km/h and covers a certain distance in 4 hours. What is the distance covered?
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            Speed = 90 km/h, Time = 4 hours.<br>
            Distance = Speed * Time = 90 * 4 = 360 km.<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The distance covered is <b>360 km</b>.
        </p>
    </div>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Problem 5:</h3>
    <p>
        A person jogs at a speed of 8 m/s. How far will they run in 15 seconds?
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            Speed = 8 m/s, Time = 15 seconds.<br>
            Distance = Speed * Time = 8 * 15 = 120 meters.<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The person will run <b>120 meters</b>.
