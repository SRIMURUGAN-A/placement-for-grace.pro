<h1 class="center">Problems on Trains</h1>

<h2>Concept Overview:</h2>
<p>
    Problems on trains are a popular type of arithmetic aptitude problem that involves calculating time, distance, or
    speed, with respect to trains passing stationary objects or moving objects. These problems help you understand the
    basic principles of relative motion, especially when objects move in the same or opposite directions.
</p>
<p>Key formulas to keep in mind are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Speed (S) = Distance (D) / Time (T)</b></li>
    <li><b>Relative Speed</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>When two objects move in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.</li>
            <li>When two objects move in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their
                speeds.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Train Problems</h2>
<p>
    There are several types of train problems, including:
<ul>
    <li>Train passing a stationary object (like a pole or a person)</li>
    <li>Train passing another train</li>
    <li>Train crossing a platform or bridge</li>
    <li>Trains moving in the same or opposite directions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Detailed Example</h2>
<div class="example">
    <h3>Example Scenario:</h3>
    <p>
        Imagine that you are standing at a train station when a train passes by. You’re curious to know the speed of the
        train, so you decide to time how long it takes to cross a pole. You note that the train takes 12 seconds to pass
        the pole, and you know the length of the train is 240 meters.
    </p>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <p>
        - We need to find the speed of the train.<br>
        - The train’s length is given (240 meters), and the time to pass the pole is given (12 seconds).
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution Steps:</h3>
        <p>
            Speed = Distance / Time<br>
            Speed = 240 meters / 12 seconds = 20 meters/second<br>
            Converting to km/h: Speed = 20 * 18/5 = 72 km/h<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The speed of the train is <b>72 km/h</b>.

<h2>Practice Problems</h2>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Problem 1:</h3>
    <p>
        A train 150 meters long passes a man standing on the platform in 15 seconds. What is the speed of the train in
        km/h?
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            Length of the train = 150 meters.<br>
            Time taken to cross the man = 15 seconds.<br>
            Speed = Distance / Time = 150 / 15 = 10 meters/second.<br>
            Converting to km/h: 10 * 18/5 = 36 km/h.<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The speed of the train is <b>36 km/h</b>.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Problem 2:</h3>
    <p>
        Two trains, one 200 meters long and the other 300 meters long, are moving in opposite directions on parallel
        tracks. If they pass each other in 10 seconds, and the speed of the first train is 30 m/s, what is the speed of
        the second train?
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            Total distance covered = 200 + 300 = 500 meters.<br>
            Time taken = 10 seconds.<br>
            Relative speed = Distance / Time = 500 / 10 = 50 m/s.<br>
            Speed of Train 2 = Relative Speed - Speed of Train 1 = 50 - 30 = 20 m/s.<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The speed of the second train is <b>20 m/s</b> or <b>72 km/h</b>.
