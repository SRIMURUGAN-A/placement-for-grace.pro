    <h1>Time and Work</h1>

    <h2>Concept Overview:</h2>
    <p>
        Time and Work problems involve calculating the amount of work done, the time taken to complete a job, or the efficiency of workers. The basic idea is to understand how long it takes for one or more people (or machines) to complete a job either alone or together. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Formula for Work:</strong> If a person can complete a task in 'x' days, then in one day, they complete <b>1/x</b> of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
        When multiple people work together, the rate of work is the sum of individual rates. So, the formula for combined work rate is:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Combined Work Rate = (Work Rate of A) + (Work Rate of B) + ...</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Problems</h2>
    <p>Common types of time and work problems include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding the time taken when people work together.</li>
        <li>Determining how much work is done by individuals in a certain time.</li>
        <li>Calculating the required time when more or fewer people join the work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Detailed Example</h2>
    <div class="example">
        <h3>Example Scenario:</h3>
        <p>
            Alex can complete a task in 10 days, while Ben can finish the same task in 15 days. How long will it take for them to complete the task together?
        </p>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            - Alex’s one-day work rate = 1/10<br>
            - Ben’s one-day work rate = 1/15<br>
            - Combined one-day work rate = (1/10) + (1/15) = (3 + 2) / 30 = 5 / 30 = 1 / 6
        </p>
        <div class="solution">
            <h3>Solution Steps:</h3>
            <p>
                Time taken to complete the work together = 1 / (Combined work rate) = 1 / (1/6) = 6 days.<br>
                <b>Answer:</b> Alex and Ben together can complete the task in <b>6 days</b>.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice Problems</h2>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>Problem 1:</h3>
        <p>
            Emma can complete a project in 12 days, and Liam can complete it in 8 days. How many days will it take them to finish the project if they work together?
        </p>
        <div class="solution">
            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p>
                Emma's one-day work rate = 1/12<br>
                Liam's one-day work rate = 1/8<br>
                Combined work rate = (1/12) + (1/8) = (2 + 3) / 24 = 5 / 24<br>
                Time taken = 1 / (5/24) = 24 / 5 = 4.8 days.<br>
                <b>Answer:</b> Emma and Liam can complete the project in approximately <b>4.8 days</b>.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>Problem 2:</h3>
        <p>
            A machine can produce 100 units in 5 hours. How many units will it produce in 8 hours?
        </p>
        <div class="solution">
            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p>
                Units produced per hour = 100 / 5 = 20 units<br>
                Units produced in 8 hours = 20 * 8 = 160 units.<br>
                <b>Answer:</b> The machine will produce <b>160 units</b> in 8 hours.
            </p>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>Problem 3:</h3>
        <p>
            Tom takes 7 days to paint a house, while Jerry takes 10 days. If they work together, how many days will it take to paint the house?
        </p>
        <div class="solution">
            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p>
                Tom’s one-day work rate = 1/7<br>
                Jerry’s one-day work rate = 1/10<br>
                Combined work rate = (1/7) + (1/10) = (10 + 7) / 70 = 17 / 70<br>
                Time taken = 1 / (17/70) = 70 / 17 ≈ 4.12 days.<br>
                <b>Answer:</b> Tom and Jerry together can paint the house in approximately <b>4.12 days</b>.

        <h3>Problem 4:</h3>
        <p>
            Sarah and Daniel working together can complete a task in 9 days. Sarah alone can complete it in 15 days. How many days will Daniel take to complete it alone?
        </p>
        <div class="solution">
            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p>
                Combined one-day work rate = 1/9<br>
                Sarah's one-day work rate = 1/15<br>
                Daniel's one-day work rate = 1/9 - 1/15 = (5 - 3) / 45 = 2 / 45<br>
                Time taken by Daniel = 1 / (2/45) = 45 / 2 = 22.5 days.<br>
                <b>Answer:</b> Daniel alone would take <b>22.5 days</b> to complete the task.

        <h3>Problem 5:</h3>
        <p>
            A team of 3 people can complete a job in 12 days. If 2 more people join the team, how many days will it take to complete the job?
        </p>
        <div class="solution">
            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p>
                Initial team work rate = 1 job / 12 days = 1/12<br>
                Assuming equal efficiency, each person’s rate = (1/12) / 3 = 1/36<br>
                New combined rate with 5 people = 5 * (1/36) = 5/36<br>
                Time taken = 1 / (5/36) = 36 / 5 = 7.2 days.<br>
                <b>Answer:</b> With 2 more people, the job will take approximately <b>7.2 days</b> to complete.
