<h1 class="center">Probability</h1>

<h2>Concept Overview:</h2>
<p>
    Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with calculating the likelihood of an event happening. It is used
    to predict uncertain outcomes. Probability can range between 0 and 1, where 0 means an event is impossible, and 1
    means an event is certain.
</p>
<p>
    The probability of an event happening can be calculated using the formula:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Probability Formula:</strong> Probability of an event (P) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number
        of possible outcomes</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Types of Problems</h2>
<p>Some common types of probability problems include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Finding the probability of a specific outcome.</li>
    <li>Calculating the probability of multiple independent events occurring together.</li>
    <li>Determining probabilities involving conditional events.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Example</h2>
<div class="example">
    <h3>Example Scenario:</h3>
    <p>
        Imagine you have a fair six-sided die, numbered 1 through 6. What is the probability of rolling a 4?
    </p>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <p>
        - Number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 4) = 1<br>
        - Total number of possible outcomes = 6<br>
        - Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution Steps:</h3>
        <p>
            Probability = 1 / 6 ≈ 0.167<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The probability of rolling a 4 is approximately <b>0.167</b>.

<h2>Practice Problems</h2>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Problem 1:</h3>
    <p>
        A jar contains 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. What is the probability of randomly selecting a
        blue ball?
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            Total balls = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10<br>
            Probability of blue ball = 3 / 10 = 0.3<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The probability of selecting a blue ball is <b>0.3</b>.

    <h3>Problem 2:</h3>
    <p>
        In a deck of 52 playing cards, what is the probability of drawing an Ace?
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            There are 4 Aces in a deck of 52 cards.<br>
            Probability of drawing an Ace = 4 / 52 = 1 / 13 ≈ 0.077<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The probability of drawing an Ace is approximately <b>0.077</b>.

        A coin is tossed twice. What is the probability of getting two heads?
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            Possible outcomes = HH, HT, TH, TT (4 total outcomes)<br>
            Probability of getting two heads = 1 / 4 = 0.25<br>
            <b>Answer:</b> The probability of getting two heads is <b>0.25</b>.

        A number is chosen randomly from 1 to 10. What is the probability that it is a prime number?
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
            Prime numbers between 1 and 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7 (4 prime numbers).<br>
            Probability = 4 / 10 = 0.4<br>
